My name is Lili Wang, and I am a Ph.D. candidate in the Department of Biostatistics at the University of Michigan School of Public Health. I am currently working on survival models under the supervision of Dr. Douglas E. Schaubel. 

My primary research interest has been developing novel methods and their software for analyzing complex failure time data, e.g., alternating recurrent events, competing risks, and hierarchically clustered events. 

Moreover, I am working as a research assistant for the University of Michigan Kidney Epidemiology and Cost Center. I actively participated in developing methods to monitor the performance of dialysis facilities by tracking their real-time mortality, readmission and hospitalization outcomes. 

Recently, I started to study regression trees and causal inference to optimize treatment assignments in observational studies.
