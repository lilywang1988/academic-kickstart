I'm a Ph.D. candidate in Biostatistics at the University of Michigan. My thesis advisors are [Prof. Douglas E. Schaubel](https://sph.umich.edu/faculty-profiles/schaubel-douglas.html) and [Prof. Peter Xuekun Song](http://www.umich.edu/~songlab/people.html).  

My research topics include developing novel methods and their software for analyzing clustered event data, like alternating recurrent events, competing risks, and events with hierarchical structures.  

Moreover, as a research assistant for the University of Michigan Kidney Epidemiology and Cost Center (KECC), I am working on monitoring charts to track performance of dialysis facilities according to the mortality, readmission and hospitalizations.  

I am also passionate about recent progresses in machine learning methods and causal inference, and their increasing use in event data analysis.
