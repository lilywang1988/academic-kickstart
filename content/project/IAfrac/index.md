1. Implementation: weighted log-rank tests (WLRT) methods proposed by Hasegawa (2014 and 2016) for the sample size calculation and the information fraction monitoring in both regular WLRT and the Interim Analysis WLRT (IA-WLRT). 
2. Development I: developed a max-combo based interim analysis (IA-MC) and proposed an estimating method for its sample size and boundary calculations to control both the power and type I error. 
3. Development II: derived the asymptotic distributions for the WLRT.
